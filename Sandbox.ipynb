       "{'Introduction': 'The modern Olympic Games or Olympics (French: Jeux olympiques)[a][1] are the leading international sporting events featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions.',\n",
       " 'Importance': \"The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 teams, representing sovereign states and territories participating; by default the Games substitute for any World Championships the year in which they take place (however, each class maintains their own records).[2] The Olympic Games are normally held every four years, and since 1994, have alternated between the Summer and Winter Olympics every two years during the four-year period.\",\n",
       " 'Frequency': 'Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games (Ancient Greek: Ὀλυμπιακοί Ἀγῶνες), held in Olympia, Greece from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD.',\n",
       " 'Inspiration': 'Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894, leading to the first modern Games in Athens in 1896.',\n",
       " 'Founding': 'The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement (which encompasses all entities and individuals involved in the Olympic Games) with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority.',\n",
       " 'Governance': 'The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games.',\n",
       " 'Evolution': 'Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for snow and ice sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with disabilities, the Youth Olympic Games for athletes aged 14 to 18, the five Continental games (Pan American, African, Asian, European, and Pacific), and the World Games for sports that are not contested in the Olympic Games.',\n",
       " 'Adjustments': 'The IOC also endorses the Deaflympics and the Special Olympics.',\n",
       " 'Endorsements': 'The IOC has needed to adapt to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements.',\n",
       " 'Adaptation': 'The abuse of amateur rules by the Eastern Bloc nations prompted the IOC to shift away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to the acceptance of professional athletes participating at the Games.',\n",
       " 'Changes': 'The growing importance of mass media has created the issue of corporate sponsorship and general commercialisation of the Games.',\n",
       " 'Media': 'World wars led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Olympics; large-scale boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Olympics;[3] and the 2020 Olympics were postponed until 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.',\n",
       " 'Cancellations': 'The Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations (IFs), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and organising committees for each specific Olympic Games.',\n",
       " 'Components': 'As the decision-making body, the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Games, and organises and funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter.',\n",
       " 'Responsibilities': 'The IOC also determines the Olympic programme, consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games.',\n",
       " 'Programme': 'There are several Olympic rituals and symbols, such as the Olympic flag and torch, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies.',\n",
       " 'Symbols': 'Over 14,000 athletes competed at the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2022 Winter Olympics combined, in 40 different sports and 448 events.[4][5] The first-, second-, and third-place finishers in each event receive Olympic medals: gold, silver, and bronze, respectively.',\n",
       " 'Participation': 'Brundage fought strongly for amateurism and against the commercialisation of the Olympic Games, even as these attitudes came to be seen as incongruous with the realities of modern sports.',\n",
       " 'Awards': 'This growth has created numerous challenges and controversies, including boycotts, doping, bribery, and terrorism.',\n",
       " 'Growth': 'Every two years, the Olympics and its media exposure provide athletes with the chance to attain national and sometimes international fame.',\n",
       " 'Challenges': 'The Games also provide an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world.',\n",
       " 'Exposure': 'Ancient Olympics\\nMain article: Ancient Olympic Games\\nStadium in Olympia, Greece\\nThe Ancient Olympic Games were religious and athletic festivals held every four years at the sanctuary of Zeus in Olympia, Greece.',\n",
       " 'Showcase': 'Competition was among representatives of several city-states and kingdoms of Ancient Greece.',\n",
       " 'Ancient': 'These Games featured mainly athletic but also combat sports such as wrestling and the pankration, horse and chariot racing events.',\n",
       " 'Legend': 'It has been widely written that during the Games, all conflicts among the participating city-states were postponed until the Games were finished.',\n",
       " 'Myth': 'This cessation of hostilities was known as the Olympic peace or truce.[6] This idea is a modern myth because the Greeks never suspended their wars.',\n",
       " 'Tradition': 'The truce did allow those religious pilgrims who were travelling to Olympia to pass through warring territories unmolested because they were protected by Zeus.[7]\\nThe origin of the Olympics is shrouded in mystery and legend;[8] one of the most popular myths identifies Heracles and his father Zeus as the progenitors of the Games.[9][10][11] According to legend, it was Heracles who first called the Games \"Olympic\" and established the custom of holding them every four years.[12] The myth continues that after Heracles completed his twelve labours, he built the Olympic Stadium as an honour to Zeus.',\n",
       " 'Religious': 'Following its completion, he walked in a straight line for 200 steps and called this distance a \"stadion\" (Ancient Greek: στάδιον, Latin: stadium, \"stage\"), which later became a unit of distance.',\n",
       " 'Decline': 'The most widely accepted inception date for the Ancient Olympics is 776 BC; this is based on inscriptions, found at Olympia, listing the winners of a footrace held every four years starting in 776 BC.[13] The Ancient Games featured running events, a pentathlon (consisting of a jumping event, discus and javelin throws, a foot race, and wrestling), boxing, wrestling, pankration, and equestrian events.[14][15] Tradition has it that Coroebus, a cook from the city of Elis, was the first Olympic champion.[16]\\nThe Olympics were of fundamental religious importance, featuring sporting events alongside ritual sacrifices honouring both Zeus (whose famous statue by Phidias stood in his temple at Olympia) and Pelops, divine hero and mythical king of Olympia.',\n",
       " 'Revival': 'Pelops was famous for his chariot race with King Oenomaus of Pisatis.[17] The winners of the events were admired and immortalised in poems and statues.[18] The Games were held every four years, and this period, known as an Olympiad, was used by Greeks as one of their units of time measurement.',\n",
       " 'Modern': 'The Games were part of a cycle known as the Panhellenic Games, which included the Pythian Games, the Nemean Games, and the Isthmian Games.[19]\\nThe Olympic Games reached the height of their success in the 6th and 5th centuries BC, but then gradually declined in importance as the Romans gained power and influence in Greece.',\n",
       " 'Forerunners': 'While there is no scholarly consensus as to when the Games officially ended, the most commonly held date is 393 AD, when the emperor Theodosius I decreed that all pagan cults and practices be eliminated.[b] Another date commonly cited is 426 AD, when his successor, Theodosius II, ordered the destruction of all Greek temples.[21]\\n\\nModern Games\\nSee also: List of Olympic Games host cities\\nForerunners\\nBaron Pierre de Coubertin\\nVarious uses of the term \"Olympic\" to describe athletic events in the modern era have been documented since the 17th century.',\n",
       " 'National': 'The first such event was the Cotswold Games or \"Cotswold Olimpick Games\", an annual meeting near Chipping Campden, England, involving various sports.',\n",
       " 'Festival': 'It was first organised by the lawyer Robert Dover between 1612 and 1642, with several later celebrations leading up to the present day.',\n",
       " 'Event': 'The British Olympic Association, in its bid for the 2012 Olympic Games in London, mentioned these games as \"the first stirrings of Britain\\'s Olympic beginnings\".[22]\\nL\\'Olympiade de la République, a national Olympic festival held annually from 1796 to 1798 in Revolutionary France also attempted to emulate the ancient Olympic Games.[23] The competition included several disciplines from the ancient Greek Olympics.',\n",
       " 'Reconstruction': 'The 1796 Games also marked the introduction of the metric system into sport.[23]\\n\\n1834 Handbill, written in phonetic vernacular, advertising \"Ho-limpyc Gaymes\" in Oswestry, Shropshire, England\\nIn 1834 and 1836, Olympic games were held in Ramlösa [sv] (Olympiska spelen i Ramlösa), and an additional in Stockholm, Sweden in 1843, all organised by Gustaf Johan Schartau and others.',\n",
       " 'Historic': 'At most 25,000 spectators saw the games.[24]\\nIn 1850, an Olympian Class was started by William Penny Brookes at Much Wenlock, in Shropshire, England.',\n",
       " 'Legacy': 'In 1859, Brookes changed the name to the Wenlock Olympian Games.',\n",
       " 'Promotion': 'This annual sports festival continues to this day.[25] The Wenlock Olympian Society was founded by Brookes on 15 November 1860.[26]\\nBetween 1862 and 1867, Liverpool held an annual Grand Olympic Festival.',\n",
       " 'Development': \"Devised by John Hulley and Charles Pierre Melly, these games were the first to be wholly amateur in nature and international in outlook, although only 'gentlemen amateurs' could compete.[27][28] The programme of the first modern Olympiad in Athens in 1896 was almost identical to that of the Liverpool Olympics.[29] In 1865 Hulley, Brookes and E.G. Ravenstein founded the National Olympian Association in Liverpool, a forerunner of the British Olympic Association.\",\n",
       " 'Re-establishment': \"Its articles of foundation provided the framework for the International Olympic Charter.[30] In 1866, a national Olympic Games in Great Britain was organised at London's Crystal Palace.[31]\\n\\nRevival\\nEvangelos Zappas\\nGreek interest in reviving the Olympic Games began with the Greek War of Independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1821.\",\n",
       " 'Success': 'It was first proposed by poet and newspaper editor Panagiotis Soutsos in his poem \"Dialogue of the Dead\", published in 1833.[32] Evangelos Zappas, a wealthy Greek-Romanian philanthropist, first wrote to King Otto of Greece, in 1856, offering to fund a permanent revival of the Olympic Games.[33] Zappas sponsored the first Olympic Games in 1859, which was held in an Athens city square.',\n",
       " 'Athens': 'Athletes participated from Greece and the Ottoman Empire.',\n",
       " 'Paris': 'Zappas funded the restoration of the ancient Panathenaic Stadium so that it could host all future Olympic Games.[33]\\nThe stadium hosted Olympics in 1870 and 1875.[34] Thirty thousand spectators attended that Games in 1870, though no official attendance records are available for the 1875 Games.[35] In 1890, after attending the Olympian Games of the Wenlock Olympian Society, Baron Pierre de Coubertin was inspired to found the International Olympic Committee (IOC).[36] Coubertin built on the ideas and work of Brookes and Zappas with the aim of establishing internationally rotating Olympic Games that would occur every four years.[36] He presented these ideas during the first Olympic Congress of the newly created International Olympic Committee.',\n",
       " 'Stagnation': 'This meeting was held from 16 to 23 June 1894, at the University of Paris.',\n",
       " 'Survival': 'On the last day of the Congress, it was decided that the first Olympic Games to come under the auspices of the IOC would take place in Athens in 1896.[37] The IOC elected the Greek writer Demetrius Vikelas as its first president.[38]\\n\\n1896 Games\\nMain article: 1896 Summer Olympics\\nOpening ceremony in the Panathinaiko Stadium, 6 April 1896\\nThe first Games held under the auspices of the IOC was hosted in the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens in 1896.',\n",
       " 'Rebounding': 'The Games brought together 14 nations and 241 athletes who competed in 43 events.[39] Zappas and his cousin Konstantinos Zappas had left the Greek government a trust to fund future Olympic Games.',\n",
       " 'Popularity': 'This trust was used to help finance the 1896 Games.[40][41][42] George Averoff contributed generously for the refurbishment of the stadium in preparation for the Games.[43] The Greek government also provided funding, which was expected to be recouped through the sale of tickets and from the sale of the first Olympic commemorative stamp set.[43]\\nGreek officials and the public were enthusiastic about the experience of hosting an Olympic Games.',\n",
       " 'Winter': 'This feeling was shared by many of the athletes, who even demanded that Athens be the permanent Olympic host city.',\n",
       " 'Figure Skating': 'The IOC intended for subsequent Games to be rotated to various host cities around the world.',\n",
       " 'Ice Hockey': 'The second Olympics was held in Paris.[44]\\n\\nChanges and adaptations\\nMain article: Summer Olympic Games\\nFrancis Field of Washington University in St. Louis during the 1904 Summer Olympics\\nAfter the success of the 1896 Games, the Olympics entered a period of stagnation which threatened its survival.',\n",
       " 'Expansion': 'The Olympic Games held at the Paris Exposition in 1900 and the Louisiana Purchase Exposition at St. Louis in 1904 failed to attract much participation or notice.',\n",
       " 'Congress': 'Of the 650 athletes in the 1904 Olympics, 580 were American; the winner of the marathon was later disqualified upon discovery of a photograph of him riding in a car during the race.[45] The Games rebounded with the 1906 Intercalated Games (so-called because they were the second Olympics to take place within the third Olympiad), which were held in Athens.',\n",

       " 'Agreement': 'Figure skating (in 1908 and 1920) and ice hockey (in 1920) were featured as Olympic events at the Summer Olympics.',\n",
       " 'Official': 'The IOC desired to expand this list of sports to encompass other winter activities.',\n",
       " 'Youth': 'At the 1921 Olympic Congress in Lausanne, it was decided to hold a winter version of the Olympic Games.',\n",
       " 'Games': 'A winter sports week (it was actually 11 days) was held in 1924 in Chamonix, France, in connection with the Paris Games held three months later; this event became the first Winter Olympic Games.[47] Although it was intended that the same country host both the Winter and Summer Games in a given year, this idea was quickly abandoned.',\n",
       " 'Opportunities': 'The IOC mandated that the Winter Games be celebrated every four years in the same year as their summer counterpart.[48] This tradition was upheld through the 1992 Games in Albertville, France; after that, beginning with the 1994 Games, the Winter Olympics were held every four years, two years after each Summer Olympics.[49]\\n\\nParalympics\\nMain article: Paralympic Games\\n1964 Summer Paralympics in Tokyo\\nIn 1948, Sir Ludwig Guttmann, determined to promote the rehabilitation of soldiers after World War II, organised a multi-sport event between several hospitals to coincide with the 1948 London Olympics.',\n",

       " 'Effect': 'Over the next 12 years, Guttmann and others continued their efforts to use sports as an avenue to healing.',\n",
       " 'Displacement': 'In 1960, Guttmann brought 400 athletes to Rome to compete in the \"Parallel Olympics\", which ran in parallel with the Summer Olympics and came to be known as the first Paralympics.',\n",
       " 'Business': 'Since then, the Paralympics have been held in every Olympic year and, starting with the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, the host city for the Olympics has also played host to the Paralympics.[50][c] The International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) signed an agreement in 2001 which guaranteed that host cities would be contracted to manage both the Olympic and Paralympic Games.[52][53] The agreement came into effect at the 2008 Summer Games in Beijing, and at the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver.',\n",

       " 'Expenditures': 'Most of the athletes and officials are housed in the Olympic Village for the duration of the Games.',\n",

       " 'Broadcasting': 'The most expensive Summer Games were Beijing 2008 at US$40–44 billion,[69] and the most expensive Winter Games were Sochi 2014 at US$51 billion.[70][71] As of 2016, costs per athlete were, on average, US$599,000 for the Summer Games and $1.3 million for the Winter Games; for London 2012, the cost per athlete was $1.4 million, and the figure was $7.9 million for Sochi 2014.[71]\\nWhere ambitious construction for the 1976 Games in Montreal and the 1980 Games in Moscow had burdened organisers with expenses greatly in excess of revenues, Los Angeles strictly controlled expenses for the 1984 Games by using existing facilities that were paid for by corporate sponsors.',\n",

       " 'Hosts': 'Thus in July 2016, The Guardian stated that the biggest threat to the future of the Olympics is that very few cities want to host them.[82] Bidding for the 2024 Summer Olympics also became a two-city race between Paris and Los Angeles, so the IOC took the unusual step of simultaneously awarding both the 2024 Games to Paris and the 2028 Games to Los Angeles.',\n",
       " 'Medals': 'Both the bids were praised for planning to use a record-breaking number of existing and temporary facilities.[83]\\n\\nInternational Olympic Committee\\nSee also: International Olympic Committee\\nThe Olympic Movement encompasses a large number of national and international sporting organisations and federations, recognised media partners, as well as athletes, officials, judges, and every other person and institution that agrees to abide by the rules of the Olympic Charter.[84] As the umbrella organisation of the Olympic Movement, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is responsible for selecting the host city, overseeing the planning of the Olympic Games, updating and approving the Olympic sports programme, and negotiating sponsorship and broadcasting rights.[85]\\nThe Olympic Movement is made of three major elements:\\n\\nInternational Federations (IFs) are the governing bodies that supervise a sport at an international level.',\n",
       " 'Victory': 'For example, the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) is the IF for association football, and the Fédération Internationale de Volleyball is the international governing body for volleyball.',\n",
       " 'Events': 'There are currently 35 IFs in the Olympic Movement, representing each of the Olympic sports.[86]\\nNational Olympic Committees (NOCs) represent and regulate the Olympic Movement within each country.',\n",
       " 'Governing': 'For example, the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) is the NOC of the Russian Federation.',\n",
       " 'Demonstration': 'There are currently 206 NOCs recognised by the IOC.[87][88]\\nOrganising Committees for the Olympic Games (OCOGs) are temporary committees responsible for the organisation of each Olympic Games.',\n",
       " 'Recognized': 'OCOGs are dissolved after each Games once the final report is delivered to the IOC.[89]\\nFrench and English are the official languages of the Olympic Movement.',\n",
       " 'Professionalism': 'The other language used at each Olympic Games is the language of the host country (or languages, if a country has more than one official language apart from French or English).',\n",
       " 'Controversy': 'Every proclamation (such as the announcement of each country during the parade of nations in the opening ceremony) is spoken in these three (or more) languages, or the main two depending on whether the host country is an English or French speaking country: French is always spoken first, followed by an English translation, and then the dominant language of the host nation (when this is not English or French).[90]\\n\\nAllegations of bribery and corruption\\nThe IOC has often been accused of being an intractable organisation, with several life members on the committee.',\n",
       " 'Amateurism': 'The presidential terms of Avery Brundage and Juan Antonio Samaranch were especially controversial.',\n",
       " 'Boycotts': \"The advent of state-sponsored athletes from the Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it placed self-financed amateurs of Western countries at a disadvantage.[91] Brundage was accused of racism—for resisting the exclusion of apartheid South Africa—and antisemitism.[92] Under the Samaranch presidency, the office was accused of both nepotism and corruption.[93] Samaranch's ties with the Franco regime in Spain were also a source of criticism.[94]\\nIn 1998, it was reported that several IOC members had taken gifts from members of the Salt Lake City bid committee for the hosting of the 2002 Winter Olympics.\",\n",
       " 'Politics': 'There were soon four independent investigations underway: by the IOC, the United States Olympic Committee (USOC), the Salt Lake Organizing Committee (SLOC), and the United States Department of Justice (DOJ).',\n",
       " 'Protest': 'Although nothing strictly illegal had occurred, it was felt that the acceptance of the gifts was morally dubious.',\n",
       " 'Doping': 'As a result of the investigation, ten members of the IOC were expelled and a further ten sanctioned.[95] Stricter rules were adopted for future bids, and caps were introduced to define how much IOC members could accept from bid cities.',\n",
       " 'Scandal': 'Additionally, new term and age limits were put into place for IOC membership, and fifteen former Olympic athletes were added to the committee.',\n",
       " 'Testing': 'Nevertheless, from sporting and business standpoints, the 2002 Olympics were one of the most successful Winter Games in history; records were set in both the broadcasting and marketing programs.',\n",
       " 'Banning': 'Over 2 billion viewers watched more than 13 billion viewer-hours.[96] The 2002 Games were also a financial success, raising more money with fewer sponsors than any prior Olympic Games, leaving SLOC with a surplus of $40 million.',\n",
       " 'Citizenship': 'This excess revenue was used to create the Utah Athletic Foundation (also known as the Utah Olympic Legacy Foundation), which maintains and operates many of the surviving Olympic venues.[96]\\nIt was reported in 1999 that the Nagano Olympic bid committee had spent approximately $14 million on entertaining the 62 IOC members and many of their associates.',\n",
       " 'Medallists': 'The precise figures are unknown since Nagano destroyed the financial records after the IOC requested that the entertainment expenditures should not be made public.[97][98]\\nA BBC documentary entitled Panorama: Buying the Games, which aired in August 2004, investigated the taking of bribes in the bidding process for the 2012 Summer Olympics.[99] The documentary claimed that it was possible to bribe IOC members into voting for a particular candidate city.',\n",
       " 'Nations': 'He cited French president Jacques Chirac as a witness; Chirac gave guarded interviews concerning his involvement[101] but the allegation was never fully explored.',\n",
       " 'Hosting': 'No bids from countries in Africa have succeeded.[citation needed]'}"
